### Introduction
<strong>In this multi-part series we look inside LSTM forward pass.</strong> Read the <a href='/articles/2019-07/LSTMPart-1'>part-1's</a> before you come back here. Once you are back, in this article, we explore the meaning, math and the implementation of an LSTM cell. <strong>I do this using the first principles approach for which I have pure python implementation Deep-Breathe of most complex Deep Learning models.</strong>

### What this article is not about?
> * This article will not talk about the conceptual model of LSTM, on which there are some great existing material [here][lstm-1] and [here][lstm-2] in thye order of difficulty.
> * This is not about the differences between vanilla RNN and LSTMs, on which there is an awesome post by Andrej if somewhat [difficult post][lstm-3].
> * This is not about how LSTMs mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, on which there is a little mathy but awesome posts [here][lstm-4] and [here][lstm-5] in the order of difficulty     

### What this article is about?
> * Using the [first principles][first principles] we picturize the forward pass of an LSTM cell.
> * Then we associate code with picture to make our understanding more concrete  

### Context
This is the same example and the context is the same as described in [part-1]. <strong>The focus however, this time is on LSTM cell.</strong>

### LSTM Cell
While there are many variations to the LSTM cell. In the current article we are looking at [LayerNormBasicLSTMCell].

### Quick Comparision between [Tensorflow] and [DEEP-Breathe]

This particular branch of [DEEP-Breathe] has been designed to compare weights with [Tensorflow] code every step of the way. While there are many reasons, one of the primary reasons for that is understanding. However, this is only possible if both [Tensorflow] and [DEEP-Breathe] must start with the same initial weights and their Y-multipliers(Wy and By) must also be identical. Consider the code below.

#### [Tensorflow]
{% highlight Python linenos %}
  # RNN output node weights and biases
  weights = {
    'out': tf.Variable([[-0.09588283, -2.2044923 , -0.74828255,  0.14180686, -0.32083616,
        -0.9444244 ,  0.06826905, -0.9728962 , -0.18506959,  1.0618515 ],

        -1.1448543 , -0.60807484, -0.5885713 ,  1.0378786 , -0.7088431 ],
       [ 1.006477  ,  0.28033388, -0.1804534 ,  0.8093307 , -0.36991575,
         0.29115433, -0.01028167, -0.7357091 ,  0.92254084, -0.10753923],
       [ 0.19266959,  0.6108299 ,  2.2495654 ,  1.5288974 ,  1.0172302 ,
         1.1311738 ,  0.2666629 , -0.30611828, -0.01412263,  0.44799015],
       [ 0.19266959,  0.6108299 ,  2.2495654 ,  1.5288974 ,  1.0172302 ,
         1.1311738 ,  0.2666629 , -0.30611828, -0.01412263,  0.44799015]]

        )
  }
  biases = {
    'out': tf.Variable([ 0.1458478 , -0.3660951 , -2.1647317 , -1.9633691 , -0.24532059,
        0.14005205, -1.0961286 , -0.43737876,  0.7028531 , -1.8481724 ]
    )
  }
  def RNN(x, weights, biases):
    with variable_scope.variable_scope(
            "other", initializer=init_ops.constant_initializer(0.1)) as vs:
        cell = rnn_cell.LayerNormBasicLSTMCell(n_hidden, layer_norm=False)
        outputs, states = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell, x, dtype=tf.float32)
        return tf.expand_dims(tf.matmul(outputs[-1] , weights['out'])[-1],0) + biases['out'],outputs[-1],states,weights['out'],biases['out']
  pred,output,state,weights_out,biases_out = RNN(x, weights, biases)

> * The pre-initialized weights and biases in line(2) and line(16) utilized as Wy and By in line(26)
> * The internal weights of LSTM initialized in line(22-23)
> * <strong>Tensorflow graph mode is the most non pythonic design done in python</strong>. It sounds crazy but is true. Consider line(21-26), this function gets called multiple times in the training loop and yet the <strong>cell(line(24)) is the same cell instance across multiple iterations</strong>. Tensorflow in the graph mode builds the DAG first and <strong>identifies the cell by the name in that graph</strong>. That is source of confusion to most programmers, especially python programmers.

#### [Deep-Breathe]

I could have done without a similar behaviour in [Deep-Breathe] but the programmer in me just could not resist. Especially since I earned my stripes in C/C++ and assembly kind of languages, python proved challenging. <strong>Without building a full fleged graph, I associated the variable name with the corresonding weight, i.e. when the variable name is same it fetches the same set of weights </strong>. This is difficult and not reccomended but, if you care to see, then its demonstrated [here][pygr-1],[here][pygr-2],[here][pygr-3] and [here][pygr-4]. <strong>To summarize in the Listing-2 there is a single set of weights for the LSTMCell despite getting called multiple times in the loop.</strong>

{% highlight Python linenos %}
def RNN(x, weights, biases):
  with WeightsInitializer(initializer=init_ops.Constant(0.1)) as vs:
      cell = LSTMCell(n_hidden,debug=True)
      result, state = dynamic_rnn(cell, symbols_in_keys)
  "Dense in this case should be out of WeightsInitializer scope because we are passing constants"
  out_l = Dense(10,kernel_initializer=init_ops.Constant(out_weights),bias_initializer=init_ops.Constant(out_biases))
  return out_l(state.h)


def LOSS(X,target):
  pred=RNN(X,out_weights,out_biases)
  return cross_entropy_loss(pred.reshape([1,1,vocab_size]),np.array([[target]]))

while step < training_iters:
  if offset > (len(train_data) - end_offset):
      offset = rnd.randint(0, n_input + 1)
  print("offset:", offset)
  symbols_in_keys = [input_one_hot(dictionary[str(train_data[i])],vocab_size) for i in range(offset, offset + n_input)]
  symbols_in_keys = np.reshape(np.array(symbols_in_keys), [-1, n_input, vocab_size])
  print("symbols_in_keys:",symbols_in_keys)
  target=dictionary[str(train_data[offset + n_input])]
  yhat,cel=LOSS(symbols_in_keys,target)


Listing-2

> * The complete executable [graph-mode][Listing-2] and its [execution script][scr-2].
> * The complete executable for [non-graph-version][Listing-3] and its [execution script][scr-3]. To make Tensorflow more pythonic, they have enabled eager mode and will be the default going forward especially from Tensorflow 2.0 onwards. However, major project as on today is still on the older version.

### Summary
In summary then, that was the walk though of code surrounding LSTM training, without getting into LSTM or its weights just yet. That would be the topic of our next article.
